History of the production of the film
    
</h3>
    
<p>    <em>The Prince of Egypt</em> was created from the desire from Dreamworks head Jeffrey Katzenberg
for their to be an animated adaption of the Fifties Movie <strong>"The Ten Commandments"</strong>. 
This Idea had been thrown around at disney several times in the early ninties, 
but have time and time again had been rejected. After Katzenberg got fired by disney, however,
he created Dreamworks and was able to finally create the movie.
